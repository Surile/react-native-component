description: How to use the React Native Reusables Registry Template
---

## Using the template

- The example components are found in the `packages/react-native-component` folder.
- The template includes the necessary config to use [react-native-reusables](https://reactnativereusables.com) components as dependencies.

<Callout>
  **Note:** The Reusables UI is installed in
  `packages/react-native-component/reusables`. If you want to use more
  `react-native-reusables` components as dependencies, you have to install them
  through the [CLI](https://reactnativereusables.com/docs/cli) inside
  `packages/react-native-component`.
</Callout>

## Building your own library

You can start by changing the `packages/react-native-component` folder name and replace all the references to it through the codebase.

<Callout>
  - All `package.json` files start with `@rnr/...` and you will need to update
  them with your own library name too. - All the imports throughout the codebase
  use aliases defined in `tsconfig.json` files. You can search by
  `@/react-native-component` and replace it with the new name of the folder.
</Callout>
